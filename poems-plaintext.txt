TANG POETRY COLLECTION

1. 春望 / Spring View
   杜甫 / Du Fu

五言律詩
城春草木深
感時花濺淚
恨別鳥驚心
烽火連三月
家書抵萬金
白頭搔更短
渾欲不勝簪

The nation is broken, but mountains and rivers remain
In the city, spring grass grows thick
Moved by the moment, flowers splash with tears
Grieving at parting, birds startle the heart
Beacon fires burn for three months now
A letter from home worth ten thousand gold
White hairs, scratched even shorter
Too few now to hold a hairpin

---

Raising my head to look at the bright moon
Lowering my head to think of home

I smile without answering, my heart at peace
Peach blossoms and flowing streams pass away into mystery
Another heaven and earth, not the world of men

8. 黃鶴樓 / Yellow Crane Tower
   崔顥 / Cui Hao

七言律詩
黃鶴一去不復返
白雲千載空悠悠
晴川歷歷漢陽樹
芳草萋萋鸚鵡洲
日暮鄉關何處是
煙波江上使人愁

Long ago the sage rode off on a yellow crane,
Once the yellow crane is gone, it will not return,
White clouds drift idly for a thousand years.
In clear sunlight, the trees of Hanyang stand distinct,
And fragrant grasses grow lush on Parrot Islet.
At sunset, where lies my homeland?
On the misty river, sorrow stirs my heart.

Last night came the sound of wind and rain
Who knows how many flowers have fallen?

Beyond Gusu City, from Cold Mountain Temple
At midnight, the bell sound reaches my boat

Again I watch the lamp shadows slant
Still resenting how early night has come
Lonely plum blossoms fall

A shepherd boy points to Apricot Blossom Village in the distance

孤蓬萬里征
浮雲遊子意
落日故人情
揮手自此去
蕭蕭班馬鳴

Green mountains span the northern outskirts
White waters circle the eastern city
At this place we must part
Like a lonely tumbleweed traveling ten thousand li
Floating clouds mark the wanderer’s mood
Setting sun shows old friend’s feeling
Waving hands, from here we part
Softly neigh the departing horses

Climb one more floor of the tower

七言律詩
渚清沙白鳥飛回
無邊落木蕭蕭下
不盡長江滾滾來
萬里悲秋常作客
百年多病獨登臺
艱難苦恨繁霜鬢
潦倒新停濁酒杯

The wind is fierce, the sky high, monkeys wail in sorrow.
On clean sandbars, white birds circle above.
Boundless falling leaves rustle to the ground,
And the unending Yangtze rushes, rolling on.
A thousand miles from home, I’m always a sad guest of autumn;
At life’s midpoint, ill and alone, I climb this terrace.
Harsh troubles vex my graying hair,
In my decline, I set aside the cloudy wine cup.

No foreign horses would cross Mount Yin.

當春乃發生
隨風潛入夜
潤物細無聲
野徑雲俱黑
江船火獨明
曉看紅濕處
花重錦官城

A timely rain knows the right season;
It comes when spring arrives.
Riding the wind, it steals into the night,
Softly nourishing all things, silent and unseen.
Dark clouds enshroud the wild paths,
Only riverboat lights glow alone.
At dawn, behold the crimson of moist blossoms,
Flowers heavy in brocaded Chengdu.

Frost-touched leaves glow redder than flowers in spring.

水村山郭酒旗風
南朝四百八十寺
多少樓臺煙雨中

Wine flags flutter in the breeze by riverside towns and hills.
Four hundred and eighty temples from the Southern Dynasties,
How many towers and terraces lie in mist and drizzling rain?

日暮客愁新
野曠天低樹

In the clear river, the moon seems close at hand.

   白居易 / Bai Juyi

五言絕句
一歲一枯榮
野火燒不盡

Year by year, it withers and flourishes anew.
Though wildfires burn, they cannot consume it,
For spring winds blow, and it grows again.

東風不與周郎便
銅雀春深鎖二喬

Since ancient times, few return from war.

My little boat has sailed past countless mountains.

Fire trees and silver flowers join
Starry bridges, iron locks thrown open
Night dust follows the horses away

Their singing drifts like falling plum blossoms
The guards do not forbid the night
Let not the jade water clock hurry the hours away

雙照淚痕乾

Tonight, the moon over Fuzhou
In her chamber, she watches alone
From afar I think of our young children
Too young to remember Chang
Fragrant mist dampens her cloudy hair
Clear moonlight chills her jade arms
When shall we lean by the window curtain
Together in moonlight, tears dried?

And talk together of night rain in the mountains of Ba
